# Contributing to Pettnaut

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to pettnaut. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

The topics here are:
- **A)** Submitting a fix
- **B)** Reporting a bug
- **C)** Proposing new features
- **D)** Becoming a maintainer


> We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes happen through pull requests.
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (see this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJnFGMclhU8&t=20s) about Github Flow). We actively welcome your pull requests:

## A) Submitting a fix:

#### Before starting work on a bug or feature:

1.  Check that the issue has the **help wanted** label. Other issues will be in progress, on hold, or otherwise unsuitable for a contributor to work on. (If you think that an issue not marked with **help wanted** may be suitable for you, it's acceptable to ask as described below, but you should always wait for a reply before starting to code!)
2.  Read the issue's description and all comments in it to ensure you understand the issue and the fix or feature required.
3.  Look at the most recent comment to see if another contributor has already asked to work on it; if so, leave it for them.
4.  Post a comment on the issue to state that you would like to work on it.
    -   Depending on the issue or feature, you may wish to describe your suggested approach so that admins can comment on whether it's suitable. If you're not sure if this is needed, you don't have to; admins will ask if they do want that information.
5.  Wait for an admin to say that you can proceed. In some cases even "help wanted" issues are not suitable for fixes (e.g., if the issue has already been fixed and was not correctly re-labelled and closed), so **waiting for approval will prevent your coding time being wasted!**

##### Working on a issue

1. Fork the repository
3. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b fix-issue-(number of the issue)`
4. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
5. Push to the branch: `git push origin fix-issue-(number of the issue)`
6. Create new Pull Request

> Please be aware that if you start work on an issue without receiving a reply first, your efforts might be wasted if it is decided that the issue is no longer suitable for a fix.

##### Use a Consistent Coding Style
We are almost using JavaScript for all the projects.
We follow this [Google's guidelines](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html#introduction) about Javascript code. And always comment why do put those lines of code, instead of what these lines of code do.


If you edit on Visual Studio Code. Installing [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) extension would be very useful.


## B) Reporting a bug:
Please search before if that issue has already been reported. Use the filter to search only on issues with **Type: Bug** label.
If is not. Be free to reported. We really appreciate that. Provide information like:
- Describe the bug
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

- To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

- Expected behavior
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

- Screenshots
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

- Smartphone (please complete the following information):
	- Device: [e.g. Moto G5]
	- OS: [e.g. Android 9]
	- App Version: [e.g. 2.2]

- Additional context
Add any other context about the problem here.


## C) Proposing new features:
We are always opened to new ideas. Try to be very consistent and always be respectful and follow our [Code of conduct](https://github.com/pettnaut/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).


## D) Becoming a maintainer:
Have more minds solving problems is very useful. We don't care about your nationality or your scholarly degree. Email us explaining why you want to work at Pettnaut. And we will schedule a meeting with you.


## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.
